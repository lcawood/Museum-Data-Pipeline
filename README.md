# Museum-Data-Pipeline-Project
This is a project to produce a live dashboard to help visualise trends in data collected from a museum about their exhibitions and frequencies of assistance and emergency requests. The idea here is that a live dashboard would help to allow staff at the museum better allocate resources and make improvements to existing exhibitions based on feedback received.
